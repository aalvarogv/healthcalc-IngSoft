    Scenario Outline: Correct values introduced
        Given I am another health calculator user
        When I introduce my weight as <weight>, my height as <height>, my age as <age> and my gender as "<gender>" values correctly
        Then The calculator will calculate my basal metabolic rate as <basal_metabolic_rate>

                Examples:
            | weight | height | age | gender | basal_metabolic_rate |
            | 78     | 184    | 25  | m      | 1810                 |
            | 55     | 160    | 19  | w      | 1460                 |

    Scenario Outline: Inorrect values introduced
        Given I am another health calculator user
        When I introduce my weight as <weight>, my height as <height>, my age as <age> and my gender as "<gender>" values incorrectly
        Then The calculator will send me another error message.

                Examples:
            | weight | height | age | gender | error_msg |
            | -12    | 174    | 25  | m      | True      |
            | 55     | -8     | 19  | w      | True      |
            | 85     | 189    | 0   | m      | True      |
            | 82     | 180    | 45  | w      | True      |
